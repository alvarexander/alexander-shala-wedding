        <h2>Wedding Information</h2>
        <p>
            While we haven’t finalized a venue just yet, we’re excitedly
            exploring our options. Our tentative date is set for September 2026.
            As we’re funding the wedding ourselves, it may take a little time to
            bring everything together—but we’re embracing the journey! We’ll
            continue to share updates here as we lock in the date, location, and
            all the other special details.
