                Who would’ve guessed that the greatest thing we’d ever find on
                the internet… was each other? <br /><br />
                It all started with a swipe on Bumble, and quickly turned into
                an exchange of messages so long, we probably could’ve printed
                them into a novel. Each text was a chapter, as we tried to share
                our stories, quirks, and dreams—one message at a time. <br />
                <br />
                Then came our first in-person meeting at Icon Park. We were both
                nervous—me, distracting myself with some truly terrible bread,
                and him, fidgeting with his glasses. But soon, awkward turned
                into exciting as we wandered through the Illusion Museum taking
                goofy photos and chatting non-stop as the Wheel of Orlando
                slowly spun over the city. Somewhere between the laughter and
                the quiet pauses, we found something real. And deep down, we
                both knew—we weren’t going to let it go. <br />
                <br />
                What followed were endless nights on the phone, staying up until
                one of us drifted off to sleep mid-conversation. <br />
                <br />
                During our many Disney trips, we explored every corner of the
                parks and walked countless miles through Disney Springs. And in
                a moment that felt so us, we ran—not toward the fireworks like
                everyone else—but straight to the funnel cake stand. Because
                sometimes, powdery goodness > fireworks. <br />
                <br />
                Alex introduced me to shows like Friends and Sherlock, which we
                binge-watched for days. And I introduced him to the wonderfully
                dramatic, tearjerking world of K-Dramas—where he quickly became
                emotionally invested (and maybe just a little teary-eyed).
                <br />
                <br />
                We later discovered a shared love for escape rooms, where we
                learned that we make a pretty great team—even under pressure and
                behind locked doors.<br />
                <br />
                We shared our favorite restaurants—our "holy grails"—and
                discovered new spots together. But more than anything, we shared
                our days, our laughs, and our lives. We laughed with each other
                and at each other, in equal measure. Somehow, four years have
                passed, and it feels like a lifetime wrapped in a blink. We’re
                still learning new things about each other, still growing, still
                laughing—and more excited than ever for what’s next.
                <br />
                <br />
                We can’t wait to spend forever together—and we’re so incredibly
                thankful to share this moment with you. Thank you for being part
                of our ever-evolving love story.
